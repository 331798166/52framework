Hey Everyone, 

It's hard to fully explain the amount of new and improved changes that have been implemented because there are just so many and a lot of them are very little but yield huge results. So I wanted to just do a quick recap of some of the bigger new and improved features!

	•	CSS3 gradients, multiple shadows, and other amazing properties with IE support when there was any.
	•	CSS3 selectors with support for IE thanks to selectivizr
	•	New and improved HTML5 video support with vimeo like skin
	•	A completely new Form Framework with HTML5 Validation (via javascript)
	•	Improvements to the Grid Framework, the CSS framework and more
	•	More demo pages giving you quick access to the features you want
	•	New Canvas with support for IE
	•	A Mobile Page in Pure HTML5
	•	Blog and Blog Article pages based on the Framework!
	•	and many other little tweaks and improvements

Even though Version 1.0 was very successful and has been used in thousands of websites around the world I feel this Version 2.0 is finally placing 52framework as the new standard for Frameworks not just HTML5 and CSS3 but general HTML and CSS! The framework has been slimmed down, a lot of video tutorials added, and we are excited to see what you will do with it! Looking forward to your input! 

Thanks,
